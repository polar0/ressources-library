# Ressources Library

I've made this project following the JavaScript Full-Stack curriculum from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library">The Odin Project</a>.

I exploited the project idea in a different way, to create a library of online (programming) resources, classified by language, so I added a couple of extras.

Features

- Add a resource with title, website, comments, category and read status
- Update or delete it at any time
- Update the read status quickly with a button
- Filter your resources based on category (Global, Web3, JavaScript, CSS)
- Your resources are saved in the local storage of your machine!

What was new :

- Using Webpack and Node modules to structure and bundle the code
- Using the 'localStorage' property to store data in the user machine
- Manipulating JSON data
- Using propotypal inheritence and assigning it again after retrieving from local storage
